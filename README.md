CSSI Day 12 - Snake
=================

Your Project
------------

This project was something I worked on with another student for the program Google CSSI. It's a snake game, with multiple levels, voice controlled motion, and cool powerups and features. It's based off the concept of the typical snake game, where the snake grows each time it eats an apple. Further details are on the home page.
